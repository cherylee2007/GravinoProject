    <h2>Lessons that may apply to your life.</h2>
    <p>
        <br><br><br>
        In digital creation, honesty is one of the 
        most important lessons young people should 
        learn. When you make videos, designs, or 
        school projects online, always be truthful 
        about your work and give credit to the 
        people who helped or inspired you. <br><br>
        Being honest builds trust, and it also 
        shows respect for other creators. 
        Remember that editing and creativity 
        are powerful tools, but they should be 
        used in a good way. When you stay honest 
        and kind in everything you create, you 
        make the online world safer, more positive, 
        and fair for everyone.
