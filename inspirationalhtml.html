            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><i>Hello, I am Cherylee Gravino, a highly motivated first-year student majoring in Computer Science at Tangub City Global College. 
                I am a Lux Mundis who is passionate about learning, culture, and art. 
                Writing this reflection helps me understand myself better and share my journey with others.</i></p>
                <br>
            <h2>Personal Background</h2>
            <p><i>Growing up in a close-knit community has taught me the importance of resilience 
                and cooperation. My family and surroundings shaped my values of respect, hard work, 
                and care for others.Education has always been central to my journey. 
                From early schooling, I developed a curiosity for technology, art, and philosophy, which 
                later grew into a passion for learning english language well.<br><br>
                Beyond academics, everyday experiences—helping at home, participating in local events, 
                and engaging with peers—have influenced how I see myself. These moments taught me 
                responsibility, empathy, and the importance of community involvement.</i></p>
                <br>
            <h2>Values and Beliefs</h2>
            <p><i>I believe that knowledge should be accessible to everyone. I value 
                clarity, honesty, and creativity in both learning and communication. And as a former
                student of Humanities and Social Sciences, for me
                Philosophy and Filipino culture inspire me to see the world in different 
                perspectives.</i></p>
                <br>
            <h2>Strengths & Skills</h2> 
            <p><i>- Breaking down complex ideas into simple explanations<br>
                - Academic Writings<br>
                - Effective Communication Skills<br>
                - Public Speaking<br>
                - Critical Thinking and so on
                <br>
                <br>
            <h2>Challenges & Growth</h2>
            <p><i>One of my biggest challenges has been struggled with balancing multiple responsibilities—academic work, 
                personal commitments, and creative interests. There were moments when I 
                felt overwhelmed, but these experiences helped me develop time management 
                skills and the ability to prioritize what truly matters.<br><br>

                Another challenge has been self-doubt. There were times when I questioned 
                whether my ideas were good enough or whether I could meet expectations. 
                Overcoming this required building confidence in my abilities and trusting 
                the process of learning. Each small success reminded me that growth comes 
                step by step.<br><br>

                I’ve also faced difficulties in expressing complex ideas clearly, especially 
                in academic writing. Through practice, feedback, and reflection, I’ve grown 
                more comfortable in simplifying concepts and making them accessible to others. 
                This challenge became one of my strengths.</i></p>
