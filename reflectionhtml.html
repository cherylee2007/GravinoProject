            <h2 class="card-title1"><b>On Faith and Purpose</b></h2>
            <p class="reflection-date">December 12, 2025</p>
            <p>
                Faith, for me, is the foundation of resilience. It's not about having all the answers, 
                but having trust in the process. In my CS studies, this means trusting that even 
                complex problems have solutions and that continuous effort will lead to mastery.

        <section class="reflection-card integrity">
            <h2 class="card-title2"><b>Integrity</b></h2>
            <p class="reflection-date">December 12, 2025</p>
            <p>
                Integrity for me especially in coding means acknowledging sources, writing clean code, and taking 
                ownership of mistakes. It extends to academic honesty—a true CS professional 
                builds their skills honestly, ensuring their work is their own and reliable. Other than that,
                I demonstrate integrity by being honest, fair, and consistent even when no one is watching,
                because doing the right thing simply because it's right is what truly defines character. 
                One of the best examples of integrity is self-discipline: the ability to act rightly without needing
                to be seen or supervised. It's not about proving ourselves to others, but about proving to ourselves
                that we live by moral principles or let me say the internal accountability. Integrity
                means choosing what's right because we know it's right, even when no one is there to applaud or correct us.

        <section class="reflection-card digital-citizenship">
            <h2 class="card-title3"><b>Digital Citizenship in a CS World</b></h2>
            <p class="reflection-date">December 12, 2025</p>
            <p>
                As future developers, we have a responsibility to build ethical and secure systems. 
                Digital citizenship is about protecting user privacy, respecting intellectual 
                property, and using technology to uplift, not harm. It starts with how I behave online today.

        <section class="reflection-card excellence">
            <h2 class="card-title4"><b>Excellence</b></h2>
            <p class="reflection-date">December 12, 2025</p>
            <p>
                For me, the best example of excellence is the ability to remain consistent
                in every situation, even when challenges arise. It's about telling yourself
                to keep trying and never quit. Excellence is the quality of being outstanding
                or exceptionally good in what you do. Not because you're perfect, but because
                you're committed to progress, driven by passion, and willing to push boundaries. 
                True excellence embraces diversity in effort and experience; it's not about being 
                uniform or flawless, but about striving to become better every day.
